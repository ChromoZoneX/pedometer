=========

This project is SUSPENDED at this time.

The project was moved from the SVN repository on the ECE department servers.

- Count the number of footsteps (may be inaccurate on your device)
- Does NOT use GPS. It only uses the accelerometer and rotation sensor.
- Shows a path from the start point to the end point on a simple SVG map (provided to us). This is the navigational logic.
- Shows what direction you're heading in.

Note: Experimenting with travis-cl.
